I recognize that this is my personal data. I wish to make my data public, as I believe it is more instructive that harmful. Additionally, the is the semi-raw data I used as part of my RDS pipeline. I would recommend taking a brief look, especially at Inferences.json, as it provides some insight on who Spotify think I am. Some inferences are definately correct. For example, I do appreciate Latin culture, listed as "1P_Custom_Cultural_Affinity_LatinX." However, the algorithm was wrong that I was a car buyer -- "3P_Luxury Car Buyers_UK."
